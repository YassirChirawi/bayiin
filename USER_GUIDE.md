## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Your Dashboard**
Think of this as your **Command Center**. When you log in, you immediately see:
- **Total Income**: How much money has been delivered (`Livré`).
- **Total Paid**: Cash you have actually collected.
- **Net Profit**: Your real profit after paying for product costs (`COGS`), shipping, and ads.
- **Performance Cards**: Quick look at your success rates (Delivery %, Ads Efficiency).

### 2. **Creating Your Store**
- When you first sign up, we ask for your **Store Name** and **Currency**.
- You can always change these later in **Settings**.
- **Tip**: You can switch between different stores if you own more than one!

## 📦 Managing Orders

The **Orders** page is where the magic happens.

### **How to Create a New Order**
1. Click the **+ New Order** button.
2. Select a **Product** from your list (it auto-fills the price!).
3. Enter the **Client's Name** and **Phone Number**.
4. Click **Save**.
   > ✨ **Magic Feature**: If you enter a phone number of a previous client, we auto-fill their address!

### **Updating Status**
- Move orders through stages: `Confirmation` ➝ `Expédié` ➝ `Livré` (Delivered).
- **Colors**: Each status has a color (Green for Delivered, Red for Returned) so you can spot issues instantly.

### **WhatsApp Integration** 💬
- Click the **WhatsApp Icon** next to any order.
- It automatically generates a pre-filled message with the order details (Product, Price, Total) ready to send to your customer!

## 💰 Finances & Profit

Stop guessing your numbers. We calculate them for you.

### **The Formula**
We track your **Real Cash**:
> **Profit** = (Sold Price) - (Product Cost) - (Shipping Fees) - (Ads & Expenses)

### **Adding Expenses**
Did you spend money on Facebook Ads or Packaging?
1. Go to **Finances**.
2. Under "Expenses Management", verify the category (e.g., "Ads").
3. Enter the amount and description.
4. Click **Add**.
   *This instantly updates your Net Profit calculation!*
